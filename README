### what is vue js?

A JavaScript framework for building user interfaces.

It builds on top of standard HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and provides a declarative, component-based programming model that helps you efficiently develop user interfaces of any complexity.

#### core features of Vue

1. Declarative Rendering - extends standard HTML with a template syntax that allows us to declaratively describe HTML output based on JavaScript state
2. Reactivity - automatically tracks JavaScript state changes and efficiently updates the DOM when changes happen.

## The Progressive framework

Vue is designed to be flexible and incrementally adoptable
